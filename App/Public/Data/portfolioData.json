    "bio": "Hello. I am an Information Technology professional that has spent the past six months studying web development. During my three years in industry, I have come to the realization that I am not satisfied with the way my career has been progressing and have been looking to make a change towards something I can do for the forseeable future. I have been programming in some capacity for my entire adult life, first starting with C++ and python many years ago in my community college days and focusing on the web development side more recently. Much of my programming knowledge has been self taught, so I believe I have the capacity required to learn any new skills I may need and provide value to your organization",
